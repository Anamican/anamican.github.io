> Dreams - the bridge between our subconscious and reality  

This blog started as a result of dream I had. In the dream a close friend of mine says, "Something is written on your forehead".

It was written `எழுதப்பழகு` a combinations of two words in [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language).

> It is said that all words in a particular language cannot be translated into other without losing a part of the meaning. 
 
So the closest translations I can offer you are `Learn to write` or `Make Writing a Habit`

I'm convinced that this manifestation, is my desire to share the things I always wanted to, hoping this will transform 
into something big in the future    

But honestly, I neither have any idea of what this all means nor I'm aware of where this path will take me.

All that I'm willing to do, is give writing a try ...

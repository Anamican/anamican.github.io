This blog started as a result of dream I had. In the dream a close friend of mine says, "Something is written on your forehead".

It was written `எழுதப்பழகு` a combinations of two words in [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language). 

> It is said that all words in a particular language cannot be translated into other without losing a part of the meaning. 
 
So the closest translation I can offer you is `Make Writing a Habit`

I neither have any idea of what this all means nor I'm aware of where this path will take me.

All that I'm willing to do, is give writing a try ...

Remember the time when you did something and people were like "Nah, that doesn't look right.."

Those are the moments that teaches us where we are, or how we are looked upon by others.
I've recently read an article about adaptability which taught me a thing or two and I would like to share my points to my readers.

I know I have zero readers now, but this article is not written for today, its written for the future. If you think about it all things are written for future, so why not shake hands with my future readers. 

> Its not the organisms that are intelligent that survives, its the most adaptable to the environment.
 \- Charles Darwin  

Coming back to the point, in all those judging moments either you might have thought "Who the hell is he to judge me?" or "Shit I've done something bad" or "I'm worthless for doing such a thing"

The things that come to your mind may range from "I'm gonna take this advice and keep working on my self to be better" to "I feel like shit. Why am I still living?"

The confrontation you have with yourself defines your adaptability. And this adaptability along with self-judgment defines who you are.

## Its hard and I hear ya 

I know life is super hard, its not easy to bounce back every time that someone judges you.
But listen to yourself for a moment, if you dont feel good about yourself then no one will

## Fall hard but make sure you fall on a bed

Its ok to fail. Its ok to make mistakes. Its ok to cry about it. But its not ok keep on dwelling about it.

Always have a rejuvenation mechanism to come back from it. For me I have the wind as my helper, I chose this because its ubiquitous.

Let me know yours in the comment.

To your success,

Madhu

Yes you heard it right. Studies have shown that binge watching releases dopamine as if you getting high on heroine or having sex. 

It does feel right after a long day of work, to come home or during the public transport, turn on Netflix and watch an episode of The Big Bang Theory or whatever your favourite series is and enjoy it with a glass of beer or wine.

But here's what does it do to our brain:

## Man of Steel

As it turns out binge watching acts like a steel door blocking all thoughts and concerns we have about something and let us immerse ourselves into the show we are watching. It provides a temporary relief from all the stress, anxiety and depression we face.

## No Discrimination

Our body does not discriminate against pleasures we have either by drinking a beer or having a good laugh with friends or working out in the gym or having a runner's high.
It simply gets addicted to whatever we throw at it. And binge watching is an easy win for it.

## Wishful Identification and Parasocial Interaction 

When we binge, we immerse ourselves in the world of what we watch. eg) Game of Thrones.
we associate our selves with the characters we watch and become a part of them.
We wish we were one of the characters we see and expect things to happen us in the same way.

## Mourning

When the series is finally over we mourn over `the loss` of connection we had with it.
After sometime it will be replaced with another series and another and this cycle goes on.


## The Good thing

One good thing about binge watching is, if we find some virtual role models in the show, we do what they do. 
So if we were to find a stoic hero who goes through a lot to get what he wants in life, we accept that life is tough and begin to act like that hero.

  
## Binge watching responsibly

Binge watching may not be a bad thing if we learn to use it wisely. Example, if one were to begin a startup, `Shark Tank` or `Silicon Valley` would be something good to watch, as they depict the reality of a startup.  

> Humans learn by observing, and having the digital media filled with lots of good videos is a good thing. 

### Just make sure to turn off when you feel like `just one more episode`

Have you ever wondered why snowflakes are created in a certain pattern or even a grain of sand for that matter?

The simplest answer is: `Efficiency`

Nature follows a certain pattern just to make sure it is efficient, take Fibonacci series for example, it is [everywhere](https://insteading.com/blog/fibonacci-sequence-in-nature/).
Here is [3 other cool patterns](https://www.fi.edu/math-patterns-nature), if you wanna learn more.

We, as human beings learn everything from nature and apply those principles to every day lives. A part of those learnings are applied to software as well.

We observed and understood certain patterns that happened again and again when solving a problem and grouped the solution patterns.

For computer science, the term pattern languages were firstly introduced in 1987 by [Kent Beck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) and [Ward Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) at [OOPSLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOPSLA) in the paper “Using Pattern Languages for Object-Oriented Programs”. 

Later on, in 1995, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides published, the now-classic, book '[Design Patterns – Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://amzn.to/2K4B8ql)’. It is that classic that’s named ‘Gang of Four’ (GoF) and it presents a collection of 23 patterns frequently encountered in software systems design. 

The term SOLID principles were introduced by [Robert C Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin). Design Principles in-essence are the rules that which these Design Patterns follow. Talk about finding patterns within patterns <span>&#128516;</span>, I feel like I'm in [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)).

> There is [a good book to learn these agile practices, design priciples and design patterns](https://amzn.to/2wLRJqe) if you wanna give it a try.


Since there a lot of good sources for Design patterns, I'll be focusing on explaining how each pattern is constructed and where to apply based on real-life applications. Be sure to book mark this page.
I'll be re-organizing this page on the go, more like refactoring <span>&#128516;</span>

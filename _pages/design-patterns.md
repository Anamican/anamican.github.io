Have you ever wondered why snowflakes are created in a certain pattern or even a grain of sand?

The simplest answer is: `Efficiency`

Nature follows a certain pattern just to make sure it is efficient, take Fibonacci series for example, it is [everywhere](https://insteading.com/blog/fibonacci-sequence-in-nature/).
Here is [3 other cool patterns](https://www.fi.edu/math-patterns-nature), if you wanna learn more.

We, as human beings learn everything from nature and apply those principles to every day lives. A part of those learnings are applied to software as well.

We observed and understood certain patterns that happened again and again when solving a problem and grouped the solution patterns together forming [`Design Patterns`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)


Also, we found these patterns follow certain rules or principles and called them [`SOLID principles`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) . Talk about finding patterns within patterns <span>&#128516;</span>, I feel like I'm in [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)).

> There is [a good book to learn these design patterns](https://amzn.to/2K4B8ql) if you wanna give it a try.


Since there a lot of good sources for Design patterns, I'll be focusing on explaining how each pattern is constructed and where to apply based on real-life applications. Be sure to book mark this page.
I'll be re-organizing this page on the go, more like refactoring <span>&#128516;</span>
